  abstract = {Preliminary design of composite laminate structures (CLS) involves a set of calculations starting from micromechanics, macromechanics, and structural analysis such as beam theory. The design variables for CLS include fiber and matrix properties, fiber volume fraction, stacking sequence, section geometry, and so on. When one of these variables is changed during the design process, all the calculations to model the CLS have to be redone. This paper discusses the use of object oriented programming (OOP) and relational databases (RDB) to mimic the design process of CLS and its elements, including laminate, lamina, and fiber. This approach ensures consistency of data and property values calculated at different design stages by enforcing known relations between the different objects in the CLS. The ultimate objective is to create a software application allowing the designer to optimize the composite without the burden of repeating calculations. The application, www.cadec-online.com, attains maximum user convenience and real time deployment of software updates. 1.},
